# Bamsense PDF Tools 📄✨

**Open Source. Local. Private.**

Bamsense PDF Tools is a comprehensive, client-side PDF manipulation suite designed under the **bamsense.works** brand. Unlike traditional PDF tools that upload your sensitive documents to a cloud server, Bamsense processes everything **100% locally** in your browser.

Your data never leaves your device.

## 🛡️ Privacy Philosophy
- **Zero Server Uploads:** All processing (merging, splitting, compressing) happens using WebAssembly and JavaScript inside your browser memory.
- **Local Only:** No trackers, no data collection, and no cloud storage.
- **Open Source:** Full transparency into how your files are handled.
